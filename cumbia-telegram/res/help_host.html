<b>The host instruction</b>

If the underlying engine relies on a specific <i>host:PORT</i> network address, this can be set or changed with

  <i>host hostname:PORT</i>

The couple <i>name and port number</i> will be forwarded to and used by the engine in the next operations, if relevant.
This is the case for the <i>Tango</i> engine: every <i>Tango</i> device relies on a database for its configuration.

The <i>host</i> instruction is used to get what is the host name and port number currently in use.

Tha <i>hosts</i> instruction may provide the list of allowed host name/port number combinations.

NOTES
1. <i>host</i> is saved in combination with the <i>source</i> in the user's <i>history</i>, so that recalling a previous action implies it operating on <i>the associated host</i>.
2. The list of allowed hosts is decided by the administrator. Setting a forbidden host will result in an error message.
   Pre defined host names and port numbers prevent mistakes when connecting to a <i>Tango</i> database.

Example:

  <i>host hokuto:20000</i>

changes the <i>TANGO_HOST</i> to the host name "hokuto", port number 20000.
