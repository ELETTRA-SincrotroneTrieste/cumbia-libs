 *        or an existing thread is reused. If a new thread is created, the given
 *        *token* will be the new thread's token
 * @param thread_factory an implementation of the CuThreadFactoryImplI interface that
 *        creates specific instances of CuThreadInterface, normally CuThread.
 * @return a new thread or an existing one, according to the contents in the *token*
 *         discussed above.
 *
 * \note if token is empty, a new thread is returned.
 *
 * \par Reusing threads
 * An existing thread is reused if the *token* parameter to getThread is *equivalent* to
 * the existing thread's token. Whether threads (or *tokens*) are equivalent or not is
 * decided by CuThread::isEquivalent.
 *
 * The *service provider* passed as parameter to getThread is directly handed to the
 * CuThreadFactoryImplI::createThread. If the CuThreadFactoryImplI implementation is
 * CuThreadFactoryImpl (that creates CuThread objects), the *service provider* is
 * forwarded to the CuThread's constructor.
 *
 * The CuThreadsEventBridgeFactory_I parameter is used to pass to CuThreadFactoryImplI::createThread
 * an instance of CuThreadsEventBridge_I, that is a CuThreadsEventBridge for a basic
 * cumbia *thread event bridge*, or a QThreadsEventBridge (cumbia-qtcontrols module) for
 * Qt applications.
