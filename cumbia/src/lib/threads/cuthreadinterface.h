/*! \brief interface to write thread implementations that can be used with the *cumbia*
 *         library
 *
 * This interface defines the necessary functionalities required to write thread implementations
 * compatible with the *cumbia* library.
 * CuThread adheres to this interface and is the default thread implementation in cumbia.
 *
 * CuThread starts an *activity* (CuActivity), calls the CuActivity::init, CuActivity::execute
 * and CuActivity::onExit *hooks* on the activity *in a background thread (c++ 11 std::thread)*.
 * Publishes *progress* and *result* events to the *main thread* when required by the
 * *activity* (CuActivity::publishProgress and CuActivity::publishResult).
 *
 * The required methods are as follows:
 * \li registerActivity: start an activity. See CuThread::registerActivity
 * \li unregisterActivity: stop an activity and delete it, if required. See CuThread::unregisterActivity
 * \li publishProgress: deliver an event accounting for a progress on the background
 *     work (see CuThread::publishProgress)
 * \li publishResult: deliver an event accounting for a result computed in the background
 *     thread
 * \li publishExitEvent: deliver an *activity exit* event to the activity
 * \li isEquivalent: determines whether a thread is *equivalent* to another thread.
 *     *Equivalent* threads run activities in the same thread.
 * \li cleanup: clean thread objects
 * \li type: return an integer describing the type of thread (for rtti conversion, if needed)
 * \li start: start the thread (allocate a new std::thread)
 * \li isRunning: return whether a thread is running or not
 * \li wait: join the std::thread
 * \li exit: use a proper event to exit the background thread
 * \li getActivityTimerPeriod: return the period of the timer running for the given activity
 * \li postEvent: post an event from the thread to an activity
 *
 * As a CuThreadsEventBridgeListener, CuThreadInterface implementations will have to write
 * an *onEventPosted* method from which all registered CuThreadListener instances will
 * receive data (CuThreadListener::onProgress, CuThreadListener::onResult).
 * The list of CuThreadListener objects is obtained calling CuActivityManager::getThreadListeners
 *
 * \par Thread disposal
 * The interface does not define a specific behavior for thread disposal.
 * CuThread implementation auto destroys itself when the last activity is unregistered.
 *
 * @implements CuThreadsEventBridgeListener
