/*! \brief a timer used by CuThread for periodic execution of an *activity*
 *
 * This class is used internally by the cumbia library.
 *
 * When the timer is started, it creates a new std::thread that calls
 * CuTimerListener::onTimeout each time the *timeout* expires.
 * CuTimerListener is installed in the CuTimer constructor.
 *
 * In the *cumbia library* CuTimer is used by CuThread. CuThread *is* a CuTimerListener and,
 * within CuThread::onTimeout a timer event is pushed into the CuThread's *event queue*.
 *
 * A timer can be started, stopped, paused and resumed. Timeout can be changed.
 * The timer can also be used in the *single shot* mode, and in this case it is run
 * only once. The timeout is in *milliseconds*. CuThread uses the timer in single shot
 * mode.
 *
 * CuThread creates and runs a CuTimer after an activity is registered. CuTimer is created
 * in the CuThread's background thread if the CuActivity::repeat method returns greater than
 * zero (in the private member CuThread::mActivityInit).
 *
