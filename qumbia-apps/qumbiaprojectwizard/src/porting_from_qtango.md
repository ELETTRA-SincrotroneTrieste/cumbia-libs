Porting a QTango application to cumbia-tango {#tutorial_from_qtango}
==============================================================================

In this tutorial we will learn how to port a QTango application to cumbia.

#### Requirements

The following components must be installed:

\li cumbia
\li cumbia-tango
\li cumbia-qtcontrols
\li qumbia-tango-controls
\li qumbia-plugins/qt-designer
\li qumbia-apps/cuuimake, the tool to process ui, pro, h and cpp files and
\li qumbia-apps/qumbiaprojectwizard, the tool to create a new cumbia project

#### Install qumbiaprojectwizard

Change directory into *qumbia-apps/qumbiaprojectwizard* and execute

\code
qmake
make -j5
sudo make install
\endcode

To build all the *qumbia-apps* utilities, the same code can be run from the *qumbia-apps* parent directory.

#### Command line

\code
cumbia import
\endcode

## Demo code used in the examples in this page

A couple of QTango applications are shipped within the qumbia-apps/qumbiaprojectwizard utility source code:

- qumbia-apps/qumbiaprojectwizard/demos/qtango_porting/simple_qtango_danfisik9100
- qumbia-apps/qumbiaprojectwizard/demos/qtango_porting/complex_qtango_demo

They cannot be build without the QTango library but they are full working projects. The code can be used 
to test *qumbiaprojectwizard* and to try to port the applications following this tutorial.
You may want to read the *README* files under the directories listed above.

## 1. Simple QTango applications with QTango base classes 

How to tell whether a QTango project is or not a simple application that can be easily ported?

A simple QTango application

- typically consists of a few source files: a main.cpp, a widget.cpp, a widget.h and a *ui* file edited with the Qt designer
- if more source files make up the project, they only contain the QTango base classes listed below or do not contain QTango code at all
- is made up of QTango base classes only, like TLabel, TPushButton, TPlotLightMarker, TCircularGauge, TLineEdit, TApplyNumeric, TReaderWriter, TDoubleSpinBox,
  TSpinBox, TApplication, TCheckBox, TSimpleLabel
  and does not employ *custom* QTango classes, i.e. objects derived from QTangoComProxyReader, QTangoComProxyWriter, QTangoWidgetCommon
- <em>does not use</em> classes such as TVariant, DeviceThread, DeviceThreadFactory, TAction, PropertyReader, EUniqueApplication, EApplicationButton, SpectrumWriter, ReadersGroup TDbBrowser, TWidgetGroup, TUniqueApplication, ...
- has a *.pro* file starting with a line that looks like *include(/usr/local/qtango/include/qtango6/qtango.pri)*



To do the following exercise you can refer to the *demo code* in

- qumbia-apps/qumbiaprojectwizard/demos/qtango_porting/simple_qtango_danfisik9100

\image html qumbiaprojectwizard-import.png "qumbiaprojectwizard application: import a QTango application"
\image latex qumbiaprojectwizard-import.png "qumbiaprojectwizard application: import a QTango application"


An application with such prerequisites can be ported with the help of the *qumbiaprojectwizard* utility 
by selecting *Import* and then *Import a simple QTango project*, as shown in the picture above.

Please <em>note</em> that *qumbiaprojectwizard* does its best but it is likely you must fix several issues in order to 
correctly complete the porting process.

After clicking the *Import a simple QTango project*, you will be prompted to select a Qt *.pro* file with a valid qtango application.
Select the <em>/path/to/your/cumbia/sources/qumbia-apps/qumbiaprojectwizard/demos/qtango_porting/simple_qtango_danfisik9100/danfisik9100.pro</em> file in the
dialog box.
Once a qtango project file is selected, *qumbiaprojectwizard* fills in the form with the *project name, author, author email, file 
and class names according to what has been detected in the project.

\image html qumbiaprojectwizard-import2.png "qumbiaprojectwizard application: a QTango project has been correctly detected"
\image latex qumbiaprojectwizard-import2.png "qumbiaprojectwizard application: a QTango project has been correctly detected"

Once a project has been correctly detected, you can try to convert it clicking on the *Convert...* button at the bottom of the 
utility. If everything is likely to be ok, you should only find *green or yellow* lines in the list view describing the process.
Pay attention to this information and read it carefully before *double checking* the <em>Output directory</em> for the converted
project and clicking on the *Convert* button on the bottom left.
If the chosen *output directory* is *the same as the qtango* application, a backup of the old project is done by qumbiaprojectwizard.
By default, unless you explicitly select the *same directory as the qtango application*, a *to_cumbia* folder is created and there
the converted files are put.

\image html qumbiaprojectwizard-import3.png "qumbiaprojectwizard application: conversion output"
\image latex qumbiaprojectwizard-import3.png "qumbiaprojectwizard application: conversion output"

We recommend not generating the output files in the same directory as the QTango original project unless you are sure that the
porting can be successfully accomplished.
Once the *Convert* button is pressed on the dialog box shown in the picture above, the files are written in the desired 
*output directory*.
Check the converted project, fix the remaining issues and compile your new *cumbia* application!

When the above dialog window is closed, *qtcreator* and *qt designer* can be automatically launched in the output directory
if the corresponding checkboxes in the main qumbiaprojectwizard window are checked.

\image html qumbiaprojectwizard-import4.png "qumbiaprojectwizard application: open qt creator and qt designer after a successful porting"
\image latex qumbiaprojectwizard-import4.png "qumbiaprojectwizard application: open qt creator and qt designer after a successful porting"

### Important note
Always remember that:

- automatic porting only works when the QTango project is very simple
- automatic porting <em>usually helps</em> a lot migrating a project to cumbia, even when dealing with complex projects

As a consequence:

- several times you will have to fix the remaining issues manually


## 2. Complex QTango application with *application specific* QTango classes

A complex QTango application normally

- defines and uses new classes that are specific to that application, readers deriving from QTangoComProxyReader or writers deriving from QTangoComProxyWriter.
- is made up of more than three *cpp* or *header* files
- needs to access QTango low level objects, such as TVariant, TAction, QTangoCommunicationHandle and the aforementioned QTangoComProxyReader/QTangoComProxyWriter
- uses objects that do not have a counterpart in *cumbia*: EUniqueApplication, SpectrumWriter, ReadersGroup, TWidgetGroup, TUniqueApplication, PropertyReader

Complex QTango projects need to follow the generic porting instructions below. They are valid for simple projects as well.

### *qumbiaprojectwizard* for complex QTango applications.

The *qumbiaprojectwizard* utility can be used to help the porting process. It can convert the main.cpp, the mainwidget definition (*.h*) and implementation  (*.cpp*),
the *.pro* file and the *ui* xml file generated with the Qt designer. It can also try to perform simple conversion in all the remaining *cpp* and *header* files in the
project folder.

Open the utility, click on *Import a simple QTango project* and select the *ComplexQTangoDemo.pro* file under the demos/qtango_porting/complex_qtango_demo/ directory:

<em>/path/to/your/cumbia/sources/qumbia-apps/qumbiaprojectwizard/demos/qtango_porting/complex_qtango_demo/ComplexQTangoDemo.pro</em>


\image html qumbiaprojectwizard-import-complex1.png "qumbiaprojectwizard application: all project components are detected"
\image latex qumbiaprojectwizard-import-complex1.png "qumbiaprojectwizard application: all project components are detected"

Let's look at the *ComplexQTangoDemo.pro* *FORMS* section:

\code

FORMS    = src/ComplexQTangoDemo.ui \
    src/demodialog.ui

\endcode

As you see, there's more than one *ui* file. *qumbiaprojectwizard* is able to determine the *UI form class name* only if

- there is one *.ui file in the project
- there are several *.ui files, but the *first "class" child of the ui element* (that is, the object name of the top level
  widget) has *the same name as the main application widget name*

In this example, the second condition is satisfied, as shown below.

main.cpp file            |  ui file in Qt designer  |  ui file (xml insight)
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
![](maincpp1.png)  |  ![](form1.png)          |  ![](uixml1.png)


Thanks to this condition, *qumbiaprojectwizard* correctly detects the UI form class name.
Now click the *Convert* button.

The *ComplexQTangoDemo* panel includes a custom reader (TDialRead) that *is* a *QTangoComProxyReader* and a custom writer (TDialWrite) that *is* a
*QTangoComProxyWriter*. Other two objects are one custom reader and one custom writer, but they use QTWatcher and QTWriter to communicate with *tango*.

A dialog box asks to choose between

- QuTrendPlot and
- QuSpectrumPlot

when migrating from QTango TPlotLightMarker.
QTango TPlotLightMarker adapts to display either scalars or spectrum values. *cumbia* graphs are specialised to display either one or the other
data format and one must be chosen. Select QuTrendPlot in the *box* and click on *Choose*, since the attribute displayed by the plot in the 
complex_qtango_demo application is a scalar double.

The conversion process shows some error messages in red:

\image html qumbiaprojectwizard-import-complex2.png "qumbiaprojectwizard application: conversion errors due to unsupported QTango elements"
\image latex qumbiaprojectwizard-import-complex2.png "qumbiaprojectwizard application: conversion errors due to unsupported QTango elements"

The contents described in the *red* items cannot be ported automatically. The issues must be solved by the programmer later on.
Nonetheless, as you can see, much work has been done automatically.
Carefully read *all the* messages in the list before proceeding to the actual migration, then generate the converted code. 
Select an output directory through the *Change* button and the file input dialog that follows.
We choose to generate the code under:

<em>/path/to/your/cumbia/sources/qumbia-apps/qumbiaprojectwizard/demos/qtango_porting/complex_qtango_demo/to_cumbia</em>

Enable the *OK, try your best...* box and click on *Convert*. If the *Launch applications after files are created* check boxes are enabled,
the *qt creator and qt designer* applications should be launched in the output directory. We will use these tools to correct the remaining errors
and port the *custom reader* from QTango to cumbia.

#### Run cuuimake on the partially ported project

Momentarily open a terminal, go into the partially converted project folder and run *cuuimake*:

\code
cd /path/to/cumbia-libs/qumbia-apps/qumbiaprojectwizard/demos/qtango_porting/complex_qtango_demo/to_cumbia

cuuimake --qmake
\endcode

\image html cuuimake-output.png "output from the *cuuimake* utility"
\image latex cuuimake-output.png "output from the *cuuimake* utility"

If you execute *make* on the command line, you will get a lot of complaints from the compiler.


\image html build-errors1.png "output from the compiler"
\image latex build-errors1.png "output from the compiler"

The main issues concern custom classes inheriting from QTangoComProxyReader and QTangoComProxyWriter. They cannot be ported
by *qumbiaprojectwizard*. Please follow the generic porting instructions that follow.


## Porting a QTango application to *cumbia*. Generic instructions.

Let's analyze again the complex_qtango_demo project in this section.
If you have partially ported this demo application using *qumbiaprojectwizard* and following the instructions above, you should
now be stuck in the compilation errors shown in the picture above. In this case, the following files should have been correctly
migrated:

- ComplexQTangoDemo.pro
- src/ComplexQTangoDemo.cpp
- src/ComplexQTangoDemo.h
- src/demodialog.cpp
- src/demodialog.h

while the files:

- src/tdialread.h
- src/tdialread.cpp
- src/tdialwrite.h
- src/tdialwrite.cpp

must be corrected manually.

In this case, you can skip to the [migrating QTangoComProxyReader derived objects] (#Migrate-QTangoComProxyReader-derived-objects)

### The Qt *project* file 
Every QTango project is built using Qt *qmake*. Let's start analyzing the  *ComplexQTangoDemo .pro file*

Every QTango project has a project file resembling this:

\code

include (/usr/local/qtango/include/qtango6/qtango.pri)

TEMPLATE = app

OBJECTS_DIR = obj

# RESOURCES += 

INCLUDEPATH += src

SOURCES += src/main.cpp \
		src/ComplexQTangoDemo.cpp \
    src/tdialread.cpp \
    src/tdialwrite.cpp \
    src/demodialog.cpp

HEADERS += src/ComplexQTangoDemo.h \
    src/tdialread.h \
    src/tdialwrite.h \
    src/demodialog.h

FORMS    = src/ComplexQTangoDemo.ui \
    src/demodialog.ui

TARGET   = bin/complex_qtango_demo

\endcode

More complex projects can contain several directives in the *.pro* file (such as *QT, CONFIG, LIBS, INCLUDES, RESOURCES*) but,
as far as QTango is concerned, only the first line is relevant:

\code

include(/usr/local/qtango/include/qtango6/qtango.pri)

\endcode

When migrating to *cumbia*, this line must be replaced by

\code

include (/usr/local/include/qumbia-tango-controls/qumbia-tango-controls.pri)

\endcode

in the hypothesis where *cumbia* libs are installed under /usr/local (includes in /usr/local/include/...).


The *main.cpp* file in a QTango project used to register with the window manager:

\code

    /* register to window manager */
    Display *disp = QX11Info::display();
    Window root_win = (Window) mw.winId();
    XSetCommand(disp, root_win, argv, argc);
    
\endcode

if this feature is still desired, you must add

\code

PKGCONFIG += x11

\endcode

and

\code

greaterThan(QT_MAJOR_VERSION, 4): QT += 

\endcode

to the project *.pro* file, so that *-lX11* is used by the linker and the *Qt* file

\code

#include <QX11Info>

\endcode

included by *main.cpp* is found.

Please note that registration with the window manager should not be necessary. Execution of *unique* applications and raising/hiding the application windows
is managed by the *cumbia dbus plugin*. 

Since the ported project's *ui* file will be processed by the *cuuimake* utility that is run before *make*, we must add the
*ui* folder to the project *INCLUDEPATH*, because *cuuimake* generates the ui_*.h file under the *ui* subfolder.
Additionally, since ui_*.h files generated under the *ui* dir can include headers placed under the *src* project folder, we must
add *src* to the INCLUDEPATH as well:

\code

INCLUDEPATH += ui src
\endcode


The *cuuimake* utility *runs uic* on the project <em>.ui</em> files. This means that *qmake must not run uic* when compiling a 
*cumbia* project. That's because *cumbia cuuimake* creates the <em>ui_*.h</em> files so that the *cumbia-qtcontrols* class constructors are
expanded to match the expected parameters.

You may want to read the [ Understanding the cumbia-qtcontrols widgets constructors, sources and targets] (../../cumbia-qtcontrols/html/understanding_cumbia_qtcontrols_constructors.html) documentation and the <a href="../../cuuimake/html/md_src_cuuimake.html">Using <em>cuuimake manual</em></a> for further details.

\code

#   comment the FORMS directive: cuuimake runs uic
#
#	FORMS    = src/danfisik9100.ui

\endcode

This is all you need to port a qtango *.pro* file to *cumbia*.

### The .pro project file: summary

Putting this altogether, the relevant changes to the project file are as follows:

\code

# 1. remove qtango project include file
# include(/usr/local/qtango/include/qtango6/qtango.pri)

include (/usr/local/include/qumbia-tango-controls/qumbia-tango-controls.pri)

# 2. add this only if main.cpp registers the application to the X window manager

greaterThan(QT_MAJOR_VERSION, 4): QT += 
PKGCONFIG += x11

# cuuimake runs uic
#	FORMS    = src/danfisik9100.ui
#

# where to find cuuimake ui_*.h files
# since FORMS is not used
#
INCLUDEPATH += ui src

\endcode

### The *main.cpp* file

QTango specific include files must be removed:

\code

// #include <TApplication>
// #include <elettracolors.h>
// #include <tutil.h>

#include "danfisik9100.h"
#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <QX11Info>

\endcode

and cumbia includes must be added:

\code

#include <cumbiatango.h>
#include <cuthreadfactoryimpl.h>
#include <qthreadseventbridgefactory.h>
#include <quapplication.h>

\endcode 

These includes reveal the name of the objects that are used in the *main.cpp* lines. Let's get into more detail.

- TApplication becomes QuApplication (#include <quapplication.h>)
- EPalette is not used anymore
- TUtil was a QTango class and all its references must be removed
- to correctly accomplish object destruction when the application terminates, the main widget (if there's one)
  must be allocated in the heap and some *cumbia* specific objects must be deleted after QApplication::exec
  is over
- CumbiaTango is usually instantiated in the *main.cpp* and a pointer to it is passed to the main widget
- when QApplication::exec returns, the main widget and the CumbiaTango instances are deleted

With these considerations, the modified *main.cpp* looks like this:

\code

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

//     TApplication qu_app( argc, argv );
    QuApplication qu_app( argc, argv );//	TApplication is mapped into QuApplication. DBus connection is provided by cumbia dbus plugin	//	 ## added by qumbiaprojectwizard
    qu_app.setApplicationName("-");
    qu_app.setProperty("author", "Giacomo");
    
//  TUtil::instance()->setLoggingTarget(argv[0]);
//	QTango TUtil:: class is not present in cumbia	//	 ## added by qumbiaprojectwizard

    CumbiaTango *cu_t = new CumbiaTango(new CuThreadFactoryImpl(), new QThreadsEventBridgeFactory());
    ComplexQTangoDemo *w = new ComplexQTangoDemo(cu_t, 0);
    w->show();

    Display *disp = QX11Info::display();
    Window root_win = (Window) w->winId();
    XSetCommand(disp, root_win, argv, argc);
// exec application loop
    int ret = qu_app.exec();
    // delete resources and return
    delete w;
    delete cu_t;
    return ret;
}

\endcode 

That's all for the *main.cpp* file. The *qumbiaprojectwizard* is designed to do these steps automatically.

### The mainwidget.h header file

The QTango header file defining the *main widget* of the examined application looks like this:

\code

#include <QWidget>

namespace Ui {
class ComplexQTangoDemo;
}

class ComplexQTangoDemo : public QWidget
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    explicit ComplexQTangoDemo(QWidget *parent = 0);
    ~ComplexQTangoDemo();
private slots:
    void execDemoDialog();
private:
    void m_setup(); // install QTWatcher and QTWriter, set source/targets on custom reader and writer
    Ui::ComplexQTangoDemo *ui;
};

\endcode

Since *cumbia-qtcontrols* objects are parametrized with an instance of *Cumbia* and a *reader or writer factory* (or both if the same object
is designed both to read *and* write), pointers or references to these objects must be passed to the main widget constructor so that children
can be properly parametrized.

Start adding the needed include files. The top of the *header* file now looks like this:

\code

// cumbia-tango
#include <qulogimpl.h>
#include <cutcontrolsreader.h>
#include <cutcontrolswriter.h>
#include <cumbiatango.h>
// cumbia-tango

#include <QWidget>

// ...

\endcode

The class constructor is expanded to accept a pointer to *CumbiaTango*:

\code
class ComplexQTangoDemo : public QWidget
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    ComplexQTangoDemo(CumbiaTango *cut, QWidget *parent = 0);

\endcode

In a *cumbia* app, the class attribute storing the main widget *form* ("ui") must be a pointer. In this example, it was already
a pointer:

\code
    // in QTango can be:
    // Ui::ComplexQTangoDemo ui;

    // in cumbia we must declare the form as a pointer
    Ui::ComplexQTangoDemo *ui;

\endcode

Finally, a bunch of new class attributes must be defined (private):

\code

private:
    Ui::ComplexQTangoDemo *ui;
// cumbia-tango
    CumbiaTango *cu_t;
    CuTReaderFactory cu_tango_r_fac;
    CuTWriterFactory cu_tango_w_fac;
    QuLogImpl m_log_impl;               // optional logging facility
    CuLog *m_log;                       // optional logging facility
};

\endcode


### The mainwidget.h header file: summary

The cumbia version of the simple QTango main widget header file looks like this at last:

\code

#include <qulogimpl.h> // cumbia-tango includes start
#include <cutcontrolsreader.h>
#include <cutcontrolswriter.h>
#include <cumbiatango.h> // cumbia-tango includes end

#include <QWidget>

namespace Ui {
class ComplexQTangoDemo;
}

class ComplexQTangoDemo : public QWidget
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    explicit ComplexQTangoDemo(CumbiaTango *cut, QWidget *parent = 0);
    ~ComplexQTangoDemo();             // class destructor
private slots:
    void execDemoDialog();            // slot to execute a dialog, cumbia independent
private:
    void m_setup();
    Ui::ComplexQTangoDemo *ui;        // must be a pointer

    CumbiaTango *cu_t;
    CuTReaderFactory cu_tango_r_fac;
    CuTWriterFactory cu_tango_w_fac;
    QuLogImpl m_log_impl;           // optional logging facility
    CuLog *m_log;                   // optional logging facility
};

\endcode

### The mainwidget.cpp: the implementation of the main application widget

See how the main widget class constructor implementation used to look like in QTango:

\code

ComplexQTangoDemo::ComplexQTangoDemo(QWidget *parent) :
    QWidget(parent),
    ui(new Ui::ComplexQTangoDemo)
{
    ui->setupUi(this);
    m_setup();
}

\endcode

and do examine how things must be modified in order to write a *cumbia* compliant main widget class constructor.

In this example we include the logging facility. In cumbia it is registered through a *service provider* (there are no singleton
classes in *cumbia*).

The main widget constructor implementation does the following:

- assigns the pointer to the CumbiaTango allocated in the main.cpp to the *cu_t* class attribute
- sets up the logging facility
- instantiates the Ui form and calls *setupUI* with the additional parameters that the form will forward to the cumbia-qtcontrols
  objects constructors

The following code shows the modified main widget constructor in the ComplexQTangoDemo.cpp file.
The necessary include files are also listed.

\code

#include "ComplexQTangoDemo.h"

#include <cuserviceprovider.h> // cumbia-tango includes start 
#include <cumacros.h> // cumbia-tango includes end 

#include "ui_ComplexQTangoDemo.h"
#include "demodialog.h"

ComplexQTangoDemo::ComplexQTangoDemo(CumbiaTango *cut, QWidget *parent) :
    QWidget(parent)	/* ,    ui(new Ui::ComplexQTangoDemo)	  // ## qumbiaprojectwizard: instantiated in constructor body */
{
    cu_t = cut;  // cumbia-tango section starts
    m_log = new CuLog(&m_log_impl);
    cu_t->getServiceProvider()->registerService(CuServices::Log, m_log);

    ui = new Ui::ComplexQTangoDemo;
    ui->setupUi(this, cu_t, cu_tango_r_fac, cu_tango_w_fac);  // cumbia-tango section ends
    
    m_setup();

}
\endcode

Please note that the <em>ui_ComplexQTangoDemo.h</em> file, expanded by *cuuimake*, resides under the *ui* subfolder of the project.

The line

\code
ui->setupUi(this, cu_t, cu_tango_r_fac, cu_tango_w_fac);
\endcode

takes into account the *expanded setupUi* method that now accepts additional arguments to appropriately
instantiate its *cumbia-qtcontrols* children.

The *m_setup* private method attaches the QTWatcher and QTWriter to the corresponding widgets and sets the source
and target of the custom *QTangoComProxyReader and QTangoComProxyWriter* widgets.
The code can be directly inspected from the  ComplexQTangoDemo.cpp file and the contents of the method body are
correctly migrated by *qumbiaprojectwizard*.

### Note

The *qumbiaprojectwizard* "*Import from QTango*" function should help expanding the main widget definition and class constructor
as described in the example above. *qumbiaprojectwizard* can help if the project is made up of numerous *header* and 
*source* files if they either employ QTango base classes or do not contain QTango specific code.

### Building the ported project

The project can be now built:

\code

cuuimake --qmake --make

\endcode

or

\code

cuuimake --qmake -j5

\endcode


### Migrate QTangoComProxyReader derived objects

A more complex QTango application may define and use custom QTango reader classes. For example *tree view*, *tree widget* or *progress bar* are
used to read values. Components not included in the QTango library can become readers in two ways:

- inherit from QTangoComProxyReader and implement 

\code
virtual void refresh(const TVariant &) = 0;
\endcode

- use QTWatcher attached to the display component.

In the second case, *QuWatcher* can be used. Its interface is equivalent to *QTWatcher*'s. In most cases, it is
possible to migrate from the latter to the former by means of the *qumbiaprojectwizard* utility.

Inheritance from QTangoComProxyReader, implies the following observations. The discussion continues related to

*/path/to/cumbia-libs/qumbia-apps/qumbiaprojectwizard/demos/qtango_porting/complex_qtango_demo*

The QTango class definition is this:

\code

class TDialRead : public QDial, public QTangoComProxyReader, public QTangoWidgetCommon
{
    Q_OBJECT

\endcode

Inheritance from *QTangoComProxyReader* and *QTangoWidgetCommon* must be removed. The corresponding include files must be removed too.
*QTangoComProxyReader* was an *abstract class*, *QTangoWidgetCommon* a concrete base class. In *cumbia* multiple inheritance involves
*interfaces only*.

Remove this:

\code
#include <com_proxy_reader.h>
#include <qtango_wcommon.h>

\endcode

Remove other *qtango* include directives as well, such as *TVariant, view_trend.h*, ...

To start porting the custom class to *cumbia*, rewrite the class definition as follows and add the needed include files:

\code
#include <QLabel>
#include <cudatalistener.h>
#include <cucontexti.h>
#include <cudata.h>

// it's enough to declare these, since header file involves only pointer or const references to them
class Cumbia;
class CumbiaPool;
class CuControlsReaderFactoryI;
class CuControlsFactoryPool;
class CuContext;
class CuLinkStats;

class QuLabel : public QLabel, public CuDataListener, public CuContextI
{
    Q_OBJECT

\endcode

The *CuDataListener* interface defines a *callback* to receive data from the underlying engine. The method 

\code
 void onUpdate(const CuData &d);
\endcode

must be implemented.

The *CuContextI* interface defines one pure virtual method that must be implemented:

\code
virtual CuContext *getContext() const = 0;
\endcode

The Context is a class that holds link statistics, creates and destroys readers and writers.

If you write the project with *qtcreator*, right click on the class name and choose *Refactor -> Insert Virtual Function of Base Classes*

Remove the *refresh* and *autoConfigure* methods belonging to *qtango*:

\code

protected slots:
    virtual void refresh(const TVariant &);

    void autoConfigure(const TangoConfigurationParameters *cp);

\endcode

The class constructors must be expanded to include additional parameters (see  [ Understanding the cumbia-qtcontrols widgets constructors, sources and targets] (../../cumbia-qtcontrols/html/understanding_cumbia_qtcontrols_constructors.html) documentation).

Normally, in a generic cumbia-qtcontrols widget two constructor versions are provided, but if you are writing an application 
that is specific to an engine (e.g. either Tango or Epics), then only one constructor version is enough.
In the following code, you can also see the declaration of the methods implementing the aforementioned interfaces.
The *source* and *setSource* methods, that came for free in the *QTango* reader from the *QTangoComProxyReader*, must
be explicitly declared and implemented in TDialRead. This is necessary due to the more free nature of a *cumbia* widget,
decoupled from any specific control system engine:

\code
class TDialRead : public QDial, public CuDataListener, public CuContextI
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    TDialRead(QWidget *w, Cumbia *cumbia, const CuControlsReaderFactoryI &r_fac);

    // CuContextI interface
    virtual CuContext *getContext() const;
    // CuDataListener interface
    virtual void onUpdate(const CuData &data);
    
    QString source() const;
    
public slots:
    void setSource(const QString& src);

signals:
    void description(const QString& desc);

};
\endcode

Let's now turn to the *tdialread.cpp* file and deal with the implementation.

Start removing the *refresh* and *autoConfigure* methods. The old *qtango style constructor* must be removed as well, and the following code will
be the starting point for the reader implementation:

\code
#include "tdialread.h"

TDialRead::TDialRead(QWidget *w, Cumbia *cumbia, const CuControlsReaderFactoryI &r_fac) {
}

CuContext *TDialRead::getContext() const {
}

void TDialRead::onUpdate(const CuData &data){

}
\endcode

To create, connect and destroy the reader we exploit the Context class. We need a reference to it throughout the whole object's lifetime.
Add a *context* class attribute in the *header* file:

\code
class TDialRead : public QDial, public CuDataListener, public CuContextI
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    // ...
private:
    CuContext *contex;
\endcode

and instantiate it in the constructor. Return the pointer to it from the *getContext* function:

TDialRead::TDialRead(QWidget *w, Cumbia *cumbia, const CuControlsReaderFactoryI &r_fac) : QDial(w) {
    context = new CuContext(cumbia, r_fac);

}

CuContext *TDialRead::getContext() const {
    return context;
}

Rember to add

\code
#include <cucontext.h>
\endcode

before the constructor implementation in the cpp file.

The purpose of the *qtango* TDialRead::autoConfigure method was to get the attribute configuration properties from the Tango database and use
them to set the *minimum and maximum* on the dial.
Let's do the same now in the cumbia *onUpdate* callback.
After checking if no errors occurred, test whether the data that's just arrived is a *configuration* type data. Formerly, *qtango* used to pass
configuration data through a specific slot with a TangoConfigurationParameters argument. Now, *configuration* and *actual read data* are delivered
through the same *onUpdate* callback. To distinguish data containing database properties from data obtained from the device, we test the value
stored in the *type key* within data. If it is equal to the string *property*, then configuration data has been delivered this time:

<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
    <th>cumbia code</th>  
    <th>qtango code</th>
</tr>

<tr>

<td>
\code

void TDialRead::onUpdate(const CuData &data){
    bool read_ok = !data["err"].toBool();
    if(read_ok) {
        if(data["type"].toString() == "property") {
            // configure!
            double m, M;
            if(data["min"].to<double>(m) && data["max"].to<double>(M)) {
                setMinimum(m);
                setMaximum(M);
            }
            if(data["description"].toString()
        }
        else {
            int v;
            data["value"].to<int>(v);
            setValue(v);
        }
    }
    setToolTip(QString::fromStdString(data["msg"].toString()));
    setEnabled(read_ok);

\endcode

</td>

<td >
\code

void TDialRead::autoConfigure(const TangoConfigurationParameters *cp)
{
    if(cp->minIsSet())
        setMinimum(cp->minValue());
    if(cp->maxIsSet())
        setMaximum(cp->maxValue());

    QString desc;
    if(cp->descriptionIsSet())
        desc = cp->description() + " ";
    if(cp->displayUnitIsSet())
        desc += "[" + cp->displayUnit() + "]";
    emit description(desc);

    if(cp->currentValue().canConvertToInt())
        setValue(cp->currentValue().toInt());
}

\endcode  

</td>

</tr>

</table>

Otherwise, if no *property* value is associated to the *type* key, we extract the read value into an integer and set it on the dial.

See the CuVariant class documentation for more conversion options.

The code above shows the new *cumbia* code (left) that does the same task as the *qtango* code on the right.
In *qtango* new read data was delivered through the *refresh* slot:

\code 
    setEnabled(v.quality() != Tango::ATTR_INVALID);
    setToolTip(v.message());
    if(v.canConvertToInt())
        setValue(v.toInt());
    else
        setToolTip(toolTip() + "\n\nWrong data type");
\endcode

The two *source* and *setSource* implementations still have to be discussed.
The first method returns a string with the name of the source of the reader (i.e. a Tango attribute or command). We 
use *CuControlsReader* from the *Context* to obtain the necessary information. Add the required *cucontrolsreader_abs.h include* file:

\code

#include <cucontrolsreader_abs.h>

// ...

QString TDialRead::source() const
{
    if(CuControlsReaderA* r = context->getReader())
        return r->source();
    return "";
}
\endcode

To set (or change) a source, we rely on the *CuContext* again to obtain an *engine independent* CuControlsReaderA pointer
to an abstract reader. Don't forget to call *setSource* on that object later:

\code
void TDialRead::setSource(const QString &s)
{
    CuControlsReaderA * r = context->replace_reader(s.toStdString(), this);
    if(r)
        r->setSource(s);
}
\endcode

#### Optional: provide a context menu to widgets

QTango widgets extending *QTangoWidgetCommon* get some features for free; mostly, a *context menu* with some options.
To benefit from a *context menu* in *cumbia*, you have to 

- add an implementation of

\code
protected:
    void contextMenuEvent(QContextMenuEvent* e);
\endcode

- declare a signal like this:

\code
signals:
    void linkStatsRequest(QWidget *myself, CuContextI *myself_as_cwi);
\endcode

Within *contextMenuEvent*, place this code (*tdialread.cpp*):

\code
#include <cucontextmenu.h>
// ...
void TDialRead::contextMenuEvent(QContextMenuEvent *e)
{
    CuContextMenu* m = new CuContextMenu(this, this);
    connect(m, SIGNAL(linkStatsTriggered(QWidget*, CuContextI *)),
            this, SIGNAL(linkStatsRequest(QWidget*, CuContextI *)));
    m->popup(e->globalPos());
}
\endcode

In order to update the statistics exported through the specific context menu option, you finally have to add 
another section within the *TDialRead::onUpdate* method:

\code

void TDialRead::onUpdate(const CuData &data){
    bool read_ok = !data["err"].toBool();
    if(read_ok) {
        // update link statistics
        d->context->getLinkStats()->addOperation();
        if(!d->read_ok)
            d->context->getLinkStats()->addError(da["msg"].toString());
            
        // continue read_ok section
        // ...

\endcode

This last (optional) step completes the migration of a custom *qtango* object to *cumbia*. The same can be done equivalently
for writers.

### Migrate QTangoComProxyWriter derived objects

Inspect the code within *tdialwrite.h* under

*/path/to/cumbia-libs/qumbia-apps/qumbiaprojectwizard/demos/qtango_porting/complex_qtango_demo/src*

*TDialWrite* is a writer deriving from *QTangoComProxyWriter* and *QTangoWidgetCommon*, in analogy with the *reader* already described.

\code
#include <QDial>
#include <com_proxy_writer.h>
#include <qtango_wcommon.h>

class TDialWrite : public QDial, public QTangoComProxyWriter, public QTangoWidgetCommon
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    explicit TDialWrite(QWidget *parent = nullptr);
signals:
    void description(const QString& desc);
protected slots:
    void autoConfigure(const TangoConfigurationParameters *cp);
    void write(int val);
};
\endcode

we can spot the equivalent *autoConfigure slot* and an additional *slot* that is used to write when the dial is rotated.

First of all, remove the *qtango specific includes* and change the constructor exactly the same way as we did for the reader.
Remove also the *autoConfigure* slot, which is not necessary. As done before, make sure the necessary *cumbia includes* are 
placed at the beginning of the *header file*. The *description* signal and the *write* methods can be reused:

\code
#include <QDial>
#include <cudatalistener.h>
#include <cucontexti.h>

class Cumbia;
class CumbiaPool;
class CuControlsFactoryPool;
class CuControlsWriterFactoryI;

class TDialWrite : public QDial, public QTangoComProxyWriter, public QTangoWidgetCommon
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    explicit TDialWrite(QWidget *parent, Cumbia *cumbia, const CuControlsWriterFactoryI &w_fac);

signals:
    void description(const QString& desc);

protected slots:
    void write(int val);
};
\endcode


*cumbia*'s *TDialWrite* will derive from the very same two interfaces as *TDialRead*.

- *CuDataListener* enables to get configuration parameters from the Tango database and to receive the outcomes of a *write* operation 
- *CuContextI* interface forces to define a *getContext* method that makes the object apt to 
   provide a *CuContext* through which to export statistics 

In analogy with the reader's case, we use the *CuContext* as a *proxy* object to connect to the control system and set the target.
Declare a *CuContext* private attribute in the TDialWrite class definition.
Inheriting from the two interfaces *CuDataListener and CuContextI* forces to implement the two methods *onUpdate* and *getContext*:

\code
class TDialWrite : public QDial, public CuDataListener, public CuContextI
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    explicit TDialWrite(QWidget *parent, Cumbia *cumbia, const CuControlsWriterFactoryI &w_fac);

    // CuContextI interface
    virtual CuContext *getContext() const;
    // CuDataListener interface
    virtual void onUpdate(const CuData &data);
    
signals:
    void description(const QString& desc);

protected slots:
    void write(int val);

private:
    CuContext *context;
};
\endcode

In complete analogy with the reader, we need a *target* and *setTarget* method for the writer. The equivalent methods were named
*setTargets* and *targets* in *QTango*. *QTango targets* allowed multiple targets on a single object. In *cumbia* this is not possible.
In *QTango*, the *get* and *set* targets methods were given for free from the QTangoComProxyWriter parent class. We need to declare them
amongst the other class methods in the *cumbia* version:

\code
class TDialWrite : public QDial, public CuDataListener, public CuContextI
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    //...
    QString target() const;
    
    public slots:
        void setTarget(const QString& target);
    // ...
\endcode


#### The writer *cpp* implementation

Remove the *QTango* constructor and the *autoConfigure* method on the *cpp* implementation. Then empty the body of the *write* method.
Let the *getContext* method simply return the pointer to the CuContext that will be used by this object.
Replace the old constructor with the new *cumbia* TDialWrite constructor

\code

TDialWrite::TDialWrite(QWidget *parent, Cumbia *cumbia, const CuControlsWriterFactoryI &w_fac) {
    
}

void TDialWrite::write(int val) {
    // QTangoComProxyWriter::execute(val); <-- remove this
}

CuContext *TDialWrite::getContext() const {
    return context;
}

void TDialWrite::onUpdate(const CuData &data) {
}
\endcode

The constructor will instantiate the *context* and connect the *valueChanged* signal of the QDial to the *write* slot,
so that each time the dial is rotated, a write is performed:

\code
#include "tdialwrite.h"
#include <cucontrolswriter_abs.h>
#include <cucontext.h>

TDialWrite::TDialWrite(QWidget *parent, Cumbia *cumbia, const CuControlsWriterFactoryI &w_fac)
    : QDial(parent)
{
    context = new CuContext(cumbia, w_fac);
    connect(this, SIGNAL(valueChanged(int)), this, SLOT(write(int)));
}
\endcode

The following code snippet shows the implementation of the *write* function. This is invoked every time the dial is rotated.
This could be optimized performing the *write* operation only when the rotation finishes, but this is not the priority now.
First of all notice that if *setTarget* hasn't been called, there is no CuControlsWriterA available yet (see the 
*target* and *setTarget* functions). That's why it is important to  watch out for a *null* CuControlsWriterA pointer.
If it's not *null*, set the *args* and call *execute* on it. 
The integer value passed to *write* is wrapped up into a *CuVariant*.

\code
void TDialWrite::write(int val)
{
    CuVariant args(val);
    CuControlsWriterA *w = d->context->getWriter();
    if(w) {
        w->setArgs(args);
        w->execute();
    }
}
\endcode

The *onUpdate* method can be used to configure the dial with lower and upper bounds, just as we did in the reader.
It's a good idea to check that the *Tango attribute* is *writable*, disable the widget if it's not, and to initialize the
value of the *writer* with the *Tango set point value*, which is associated to the *w_value key*.
If the attribute description and *display unit* are available, use them (emit the *description signal*):

\code
void TDialWrite::onUpdate(const CuData &data) {
    bool read_ok = !data["err"].toBool();
    bool format_ok = da["data_format_str"] == "scalar" && da["writable"].toInt() > 0;
    if(read_ok && format_ok) {
        QString desc;
        if(data["type"].toString() == "property") {
            // configure!
            double m, M;
            if(data["min"].to<double>(m) && data["max"].to<double>(M)) {
                setMinimum(m);
                setMaximum(M);
            }
            if(data["description"].toString().size())
                desc = QString::fromStdString(data["description"].toString());
            if(data["display_unit"].toString().size())
                desc += " [" + QString::fromStdString(data["display_unit"].toString()) + "]";
            if(!desc.isEmpty())
                emit description(desc);
        }
        else {
            int v;
            data["w_value"].to<int>(v);
            setValue(v);
        }
    }
    else if(!format_ok)
        setToolTip("the data format of " + QString::fromStdString(data["src"].toString()) + " is not scalar or not writable");
    else
        setToolTip(QString::fromStdString(data["msg"].toString()));

    setEnabled(read_ok && format_ok);
}

\endcode

Finally, write the implementation of *target* and *setTarget* in the *cpp* file:

\code

QString TDialWrite::target() const
{
    CuControlsWriterA *w = d->context->getWriter();
    if(w != NULL)
        return w->target();
    return "";
}

void TDialWrite::setTarget(const QString &targets)
{
    CuControlsWriterA* w = d->context->replace_writer(targets.toStdString(), this);
    if(w) w->setTarget(targets);
}
\endcode

It's now time to try to build the *complex project*. Open a terminal into the 

*/path/to/cumbia-libs/qumbia-apps/qumbiaprojectwizard/demos/qtango_porting/complex_qtango_demo/src*

directory and execute 

\code
cuuimake --pre-clean --qmake
\endcode

The picture below shows the output of the *cuuimake* utility. It detected two *custom classes* that *are* cumbia objects:

- TDialRead
- TDialWrite

Definitions are automatically added by *cuuimake* so that *expansion* takes place for both classes *just as if* they were part of the *cumbia-qtcontrols*
library.

\image html cuuimake-output2.png "cuuimake: process the cumbia project and auto detect custom classes"
\image latex cuuimake-output2.png "cuuimake: process the cumbia project and auto detect custom classes"

### Final steps of the *complex project* porting recipe

The *complex project* under examination is made up of *two ui* files and  *two classes* that respectively use the forms defined in the *ui* files:

\code
cd /path/to/cumbia-libs/qumbia-apps/qumbiaprojectwizard/demos/qtango_porting/complex_qtango_demo/src
ls
\endcode

\image html ls_src.png "list of the complex qtango sources"
\image latex ls_src.png "list of the complex qtango sources"

There we can find

- The main widget class defined in *ComplexQTangoDemo.h* and *ComplexQTangoDemo.cpp*. Form described in *ComplexQTangoDemo.ui*
- A dialog window class defined in *demodialog.h* and *demodialog.cpp*. Form described in *demodialog.ui*

The *qumbiaprojectwizard* is targeted to porting a *simple* project with a *main widget* class with one *ui* form.
The utility reads the *main.cpp*, finds the candidate *main widget class name* and scans the other source files in order to find its definition.
For this reason, *ComplexQTangoDemo.h*, *ComplexQTangoDemo.cpp* and *ComplexQTangoDemo.ui* can be ported automatically also in this *complex example*.

On the other hand <em>*demodialog.h*, *demodialog.cpp* and *demodialog.ui* need further attention</em>.
Actually, *demodialog.ui* is processed and the *QTango* classes have been replaced by their *cumbia* counterparts.
When *cuuimake* processes *demodialog.ui*, finds *cumbia* classes within the *ui_demodialog.h* file generated by *uic*, the Qt *ui* compiler. They are expanded.
For example, if you open *ui_demodialog.ui* you will find lines like this:

\code
        tPlotLightMarker = new QuTrendPlot(DemoDialog, cu_t, cu_tango_r_fac);
        tPlotLightMarker->setObjectName(QStringLiteral("tPlotLightMarker"));
\endcode

This means that QuTrendPlot has been correctly instantiated with the additional *cumbia* parameters.
The *void setupUi* method definition has been also expanded by *cuuimake*:

\code
 void setupUi(QDialog *DemoDialog, CumbiaTango *cu_t, const CuTReaderFactory& cu_tango_r_fac, const CuTWriterFactory& cu_tango_w_fac)
\endcode

#### Port *demodialog.h* header file

As previously mentioned, *demodialog.h* has not been processed by *qumbiaprojectwizard*, because it is not the *main widget* class of a simple project.

You have to do this manually, and it is very simple indeed. It's enough to make it look exactly like
*ComplexQTangoDemo.h*! (include files and additional *private class members*)

Open *ComplexQTangoDemo.h* and copy the *two* sections delimited by 

\code
// cumbia-tango
...
// cumbia-tango
\endcode

to the *demodialog.h*,
*exactly in the same position as they are in ComplexQTangoDemo.h*. 
Then *expand* the constructor definition adding the *CumbiaTango* parameter.
The modified version will look like this:

\code
#ifndef DEMODIALOG_H
#define DEMODIALOG_H

// cumbia-tango                  <--  first cumbia-tango section, copied from ComplexQTangoDemo.h
#include <qulogimpl.h>
#include <cutcontrolsreader.h>
#include <cutcontrolswriter.h>
#include <cumbiatango.h>
// cumbia-tango                  <--  end of first cumbia-tango section

#include <QDialog>

namespace Ui {
class DemoDialog;
}

class DemoDialog : public QDialog
{
    Q_OBJECT

public:
    explicit DemoDialog(CumbiaTango *cut, QWidget *parent = 0);  // 
    ~DemoDialog();

private:
    Ui::DemoDialog *ui;                       // <-- this is already ok!

    // cumbia-tango                            <--  second cumbia-tango section, copied from ComplexQTangoDemo.h
        CumbiaTango *cu_t;
        CuTReaderFactory cu_tango_r_fac;
        CuTWriterFactory cu_tango_w_fac;
        QuLogImpl m_log_impl;
        CuLog *m_log;
    // cumbia-tango                            <--  end of second cumbia-tango section
};  

#endif // DEMODIALOG_H
\endcode

Please note that the declaration:

\code
    Ui::DemoDialog *ui;
\endcode
    
already implies the instantiation of *Ui::DemoDialog* in the *heap*, which is required in *cumbia*.

The mofified code adds the necessary *cumbia specific* class attributes and the needed *include files*.

#### Port *demodialog.cpp* cpp file

As explained before, the *setupUi* method has been expanded by *cuuimake* in *ui_demodialog.h* like this:

\code
 void setupUi(QDialog *DemoDialog, CumbiaTango *cu_t, const CuTReaderFactory& cu_tango_r_fac, const CuTWriterFactory& cu_tango_w_fac) 
 {
  // ... in 
 }
\endcode

What you have to do is open the *demodialog.cpp*, change the constructor from

\code
DemoDialog::DemoDialog(QWidget *parent) :
    QDialog(parent),
    ui(new Ui::DemoDialog)
\endcode

to

\code
DemoDialog::DemoDialog(CumbiaTango *cut, QWidget *parent) :
    QDialog(parent)
\endcode

as defined in the *demodialog.h*.

Then, copy the *CumbiaTango pointer* into the *cu_t* class attribute and complete the paramters to *setupUi* so that they match the ones defined in *ui_demodialog.h*.

From:

\code
ui->setupUi(this);
\endcode

to:

\code
    cu_t = cut;
    ui->setupUi(this, cut, cu_tango_r_fac, cu_tango_w_fac);
\endcode

Optional code can be copied from the *ComplexQTangoDemo* constructor in *ComplexQTangoDemo.cpp* if you want to add the *logging facility*
and allow the *cumbia widgets* to provide a context menu.

Since the *DemoDialog* constructor accepts now two parameters (not only the parent QWidget as before), we must locate where in the project
the *DemoDialog* is instantiated. We can easily spot that this occurs in the *ComplexQTangoDemo.cpp* file:

\code
void ComplexQTangoDemo::execDemoDialog()
{
    DemoDialog dd(this);
    dd.exec();
}
\endcode

The new code will be:

\code
void ComplexQTangoDemo::execDemoDialog()
{
    DemoDialog dd(cu_t, this);
    dd.exec();
}
\endcode

where cu_t is a pointer to *CumbiaTango*, passed from the *main.cpp* into the *main widget class constructor*.

Congratulations! If you carefully followed these instructions and thoroughly understood all the steps, the project should now build successfully and work!
